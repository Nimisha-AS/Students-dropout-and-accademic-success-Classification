# **Students' Dropout and Academic Success Classification**

*Student dropout is a pressing concern for universities, impacting graduation rates and institutional success. This study investigated the potential of predicting dropout risk using data readily available at the time of enrollment. We constructed a dataset encompassing student demographics, socio-economic background, chosen degree program, and academic performance during the first two semesters. This data allows us to build models that categorize students into three groups: those who drop out, those who achieve academic success, and those with "other" outcomes (e.g., average performers).*

*However, it's important to acknowledge the data's limitations. Combining information from various sources can introduce inconsistencies, and the majority of students might fall under the "other" category, necessitating special techniques during model development.*

*Despite these limitations, this data-driven approach offers valuable insights. By identifying students at risk of dropping out early, institutions can implement targeted interventions to improve retention rates and create a more supportive learning environment for all students.*
